# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge  -- Employee Tracker

## Description

This is my submission for the E-Commerce Back End challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. This challenge aimed to create back-end functionality for a server that can apply CRUD functions to a pre-existing database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with your own values. Use `.env.example` as a template.
4. Seed the database with `npm run seed.`



## Usage

Start the server with `npm run start.`

In Insomnia, enter the route localhost:3001/api/. 

The following extensions can be added to that route: categories/, products/, and tags/. GET and POST can be from this point. You can also add the id of an existing entry in the database to read, update, or delete with GET, PUT, and DELETE that specific entry
